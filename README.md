A "Smart" home system writen in nodejs for controlling things around my house.

## About the project
Main focus for this project right now is to be a replacement for my old and depricated project [Scontrol](github.com/ElectroGamez/scontrol). I have writen that program almost a year ago now and would like remake it with my new programming knowledge.

### Features
- [] (Arduino) hardware control for lights (with wireless functionality)
- [] Speaker / music support.
- [] Automation, timers, events
- [] Voice assistant support (Google)

I need to do some investigation to see if I need all these features to be in this project, I have seen HomeAssistant and it looked quite promissing, but I like to make things myself.
